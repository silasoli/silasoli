   Hello! My name is Silas, I'm 22 years old, and I've been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. I've been working in IT since 2016, and since 2019, I've been focused on software development.

In 2019, I started my studies in systems analysis and development at SENAI-BA, and since then, I've been honing my technical skills. I consider resilience in bug fixing, flexibility, teamwork, organization and time management, ability to work under pressure, and leadership as my soft skills.

Currently, I'm on my second job, also focused on backend, DevOps, and development leadership, using tools like Node.js, Rethink, TypeORM, Linux, and other technologies. This experience has allowed me to further expand my technical knowledge and leadership skills.

My goal is to become a highly skilled backend developer and contribute to challenging and innovative projects. If you're looking for a technology professional who is passionate about continuous learning and dedicated to teamwork, I would be an excellent choice. Shall we chat?
