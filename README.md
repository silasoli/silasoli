  <p align="justify">
   Hello! My name is Silas, I'm 22 years old, and I've been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. I've been working in IT since 2016, and since 2019, I've been focused on software development.

In 2019, I started my studies in systems analysis and development at SENAI-BA, and since then, I've been honing my technical skills. I consider resilience in bug fixing, flexibility, teamwork, organization and time management, ability to work under pressure, and leadership as my soft skills.

My goal is to become a highly skilled backend developer and contribute to challenging and innovative projects. If you're looking for a technology professional who is passionate about continuous learning and dedicated to teamwork, I would be an excellent choice. Shall we chat?
